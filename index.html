	<div id="wrapper"><a href="Elias.html">Elias</a>

	 <p class="small bio" id="intro_paragraph">Graduated from the <strong>Central High Arts School</strong> in <span>Santurce Puerto Rico</span> in 1998, Elias likes to get his ideas straight from his mind and do his best
	in creating the job. Here in his girl at the beach, the paint has a funny story. Elias painted the girl just with a nice small bikini and when he brought 
	the art to his teacher, she said it was a wonderful job, but too strong for a high school kid so she ask Elias to paint the skirt on the girl.
	Funny thing is that the girl that Elias painted from his mind looks exactly like his wife.. maybe it was destiny.</p></div>	 
	 	
	<div id="wrapper1"><a href="Carelis.html">Carelis</a>
	 
    <p class="small bio">Like her brother, Carelis also graduated from <strong>Central High Arts School</strong> and took herself through the art world in a special way.
    This paint here by Carelis represented Puerto Rico for a year at the U.S. congress as part of an art Expo. Carelis painted the piece overnight
    just being responsible with her duties and deliver her job. Amazing that just a simple paint of a beach will represent the island in such an important
    place.</p></div>
     
	<div id="wrapper2"><a href="Saelis.html">Saelis</a>
	 
	<p class="small bio">Like her brothers from he same schooll Saelis developed herself in the public design enviroment. With a very stron attitude
	Saelis likes to deliver a clean job at the right time. Here is an example she worked on for her brother (me) for an idea I had
 	a long time ago but I always kept it as an example of how fast she can work an idea. Only took her some minutes.</p></div>
	 			
	<div id="wrapper3"><a href="Elianis.html">Elianis</a>

 	 <p class="small bio">Last but not least my sister Elianis that being the younger one, took a litle bit of her brothers and create a great strong talent	
  	for paint. Also, love the way she look for inspiration for her jobs. In this self-portrait with three posses of her and you can see
 	the detail on her face and the expresion. It looks like a huge printing picture poster.</p></div>
