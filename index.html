			<div>
				<p>High-speed Internet, 4G wireless, the latest operating system for the industry’s most souped-up laptop… 
				and it’s all still a snail’s pace to <strong>The Flash.</strong>Young Barry Allen’s life stopped the minute his mother was murdered.
				The true killer never found, its mystery obsessed Barry, driving him to become a forensic scientist. Consumed by his
				work, he spent his life chained to his desk, solving every case that flew across it. But when a freak lightning bolt
			    hits a nearby shelf in his lab, Barry receives super-speed, becoming the Flash. Now, he’ll race up buildings, across
			    oceans, and around the world to get his man—while getting introduced to a world so much bigger than his old life of microscopes 
			    and cold cases.</p>
			    
			    <p>Able to run at near light-speeds, his powers provide the ultimate caffeine kick: He can run up buildings, move so swiftly 
			    he phases through objects, create sonic booms with the snap of his fingers—and never need to order delivery. Despite his speed, 
			    Barry can become so obsessed with crime-solving he can still lose track of everything else around him, leaving the fastest man 
			    alive constantly running a minute behind.<a href="http://www.dccomics.com/characters/the-flash"><em>Dc Comics</em></a></p>

				<h2>The Scarlet Team</h2>
				
					<p>Nicknamed the <strong>Scarlet Speedster</strong>, all incarnations of the Flash possess "super-speed", which includes the ability to run 
					and move extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes and seemingly violate certain laws of physics. Thus far, four different 
					characters—each of whom somehow gained the power of "super-speed"—have assumed the identity of the Flash: <em>Jay Garrick</em> 
					(1940–present), <em>Barry Allen</em> (1956–1985, 2008–present), <em>Wally West (1986–2006</em>, 2007–present), and <em>Bart Allen</em> (2006–2007, 
					2009–present). Before Wally and Bart's ascension to the mantle of the Flash, they were both Flash protégés under the same 
					name Kid Flash.<p>
					
					<p>The second incarnation of the Flash, Barry Allen, is generally considered the first hero of the Silver Age of comic books 
					and the superhero has remained one of DC's most popular ever since. Each version of the Flash has been a key member of at least 
					one of DC's premier teams: the Justice Society of America, the Justice League, and the Teen Titans. Wally West has recently 
					rejoined the Justice League, and Barry Allen recently returned to life in the pages of Final Crisis.</p>
					
					<p>The Barry Allen version of the character (with Wally West elements) was featured in a live action television series in 1990, 
					starring John Wesley Shipp. The Wally West version of the Flash (but with many elements of Barry Allen's story) is featured in 
					the animated series Justice League.</p>
					
					<p>The Flashes have often been close friends with the various men who have been the Green Lantern; the most notable friendships 
					have been forged between Jay Garrick and Alan Scott (the Golden Age Green Lantern), Barry Allen and Hal Jordan (the Silver Age 
					Green Lantern) and Wally West and Kyle Rayner (the modern Green Lantern), as well as Jordan's friendship with West.</p>
